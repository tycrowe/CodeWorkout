Title: teenSum

Language: Java
Tags:     if, condition, plus, integer


Stem:
Given two `int`s, _a_ and _b_, return their sum. However, "teen" values in the
range 13..19, inclusive, are extra lucky. So if either value is a teen,
just return 19.


Code:
public class Answer
{
    \show[
    public int teenSum(int a, int b)
    {
        \[
        if (a >= 13 && a <= 19
            || b >= 13 && b <= 19)
        {
            return 19;
        }
        else
        {
            return a + b;
        }
        ]\
    }
    ]\
}
