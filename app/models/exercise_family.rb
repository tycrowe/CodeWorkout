# =============================================================================
# Represents a collection of similar, highly overlapping exercises that
# are all minor variations on the same question.  For example, one question
# might ask a student to write a method X, while another might show code
# for the same method X with a MC prompt about identifying the location
# of a bug, while a third might give the student buggy code to edit and
# fix.
#
# Normally, one wouldn't want to give more than one of these closely
# related questions on a workout, and ExerciseFamily is intended to
# reflect the "closely related" nature of these variants of the same
# question--they are different Exercises, but in the same family.
