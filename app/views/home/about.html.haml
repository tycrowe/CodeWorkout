%h1 About CodeWorkout

%p
  Rudimentary programming skills are essential to developing fundamental
  proficiency in computer science. However, learning programming techniques
  can be challenging and frustrating for many students. Without interventions
  to curb these frustrations, introductory computer science courses will
  suffer from attrition and poor retention rates will follow.
  While drill-and-practice tools are emerging to help students develop basic
  programming techniques and improve their confidence, they still have
  limitations.

%p
  %strong CodeWorkout
  aims to address this problem by providing full-spectrum drill-and-practice
  support while actively and adaptively assisting students when they require
  help on exercises. Likewise, CodeWorkout aims to bring the potential for
  peer learning into the mix, while effectively leveraging modern social
  collaboration mechanisms online.

  CodeWorkout is a
  %strong free, open-source
  system where students can practice programming with the assistance of
  adaptive, social scaffolding. The system includes a rich interface where
  students: program their exercise solutions, run their code and view results,
  receive adaptive hints, and review relevant code examples. The code examples
  also provide an opportunity not only to review demonstrated techniques, but
  also to actively explore how the techniques work by observing how the
  provided code executes, even with modifications. Additionally, when
  students struggle to solve an exercise, CodeWorkout provides hints to
  overcome obstacles in learning. These hints are vetted by the system
  and adaptively selected to help students based on their progress on
  the solution. This design offers substantial scaffolding to foster
  growth in programming skills while alleviating frustrations.

%p
  In addition to hosting moderated exercises written by content area
  experts, CodeWorkout also encourages students to contribute content
  by authoring both hints and exercises. Creating content encourages students
  to reflect on their understanding of problem solving techniques so they
  can help their peers. These contributions advocate social responsibility
  and productive education through peer learning. Furthermore, the system
  automatically assesses the quality and effectiveness of exercises and hints
  to continuously improve the learning experience while minimizing the
  administrative burden of editing and removing poor content.
