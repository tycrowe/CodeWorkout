    %p
      For learners of any age, CodeWorkout provides a place for you
      to practice your skills and develop your knowledge, both through
      code writing activities and questions about programming knowledge.

      assignments using exercises from our question bank, or exercises

    %h2 What Is CodeWorkout?
    %p
      CodeWorkout is an online system for people learning a programming
      language for the first time. It is a free, open-source solution for
      practicing small programming problems. Students may practice
      coding exercises on a variety of programming concepts within the
      convenience of a web browser! Exercises provide customized, immediate
      feedback to support learning and suggests appropriate exercises as
      students improve their mastery.
    %p
      CodeWorkout was inspired by many great systems built by others, but
      aims to bring together the best from earlier forerunners while adding
      important new features.  It provides comprehensive support for teachers
      who want to use coding exercises in their courses, while also
      maintaining flexibility for self-paced learners who aren't part of an
      organized course.

    %h2 Have to Be a Student?
    %p
      No, you do not have to be a student in a course to use CodeWorkout.
      While CodeWorkout provides comprehensive support for teachers who want
      to use exercises as part of course assignments, quizzes, and tests,
      this site also supports independent learners who are just practicing
      on their own.  You can go to the "Gym" here and practice any exercises
      that are available on any topic of your interest at any time, whether
      or not you are enrolled in a course.  Even if you're in a course, you
      can practice exercises on any topic you like, regardless of what your
      teacher has assigned.  Build the skills you are interested in at
      your own pace, in your own order of preference.

    %h2 Why Not Web-CAT?
    %p
      Web-CAT is a separate open-source tool (by the same development team!)
      for automatically grading programming assignments.  It is aimed at
      larger assignments (lab assignments, programming assignments, group
      projects, etc.) that take students from a few hours to a few months
      to write, and that typically involve creating one or more entire
      program classes, up to a producing complete program.
    %p
      CodeWorkout, on the other hand, focuses on small practice exercises
      where a student might do 10 or 20 together as part of one assignment.
      These are often multiple choice questions, or exercises that require
      you to write, debug, or interpret a single method or function.  Think
      "homework questions" rather than "programming projects".  At this scale,
      CodeWorkout provides many services for both student feedback and for
      instructor assignment management that are not provided by other systems.
